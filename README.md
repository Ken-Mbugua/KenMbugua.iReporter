# iReporter

**A Corruption watchdogs and incidents reporter application.**

iReporter seeks to bring more corruption cases to light by providing a very easily and accesible platform.
This platform will enable any member of the public to report a corruption incidence or even issues that require
government intervention.
All this while providing some degree of anonimity.
